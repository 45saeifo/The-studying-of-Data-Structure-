##**Project1-List:**
We build a program for our studying in List.

##***Project1-Stack:***
In our studying,stack is a easy data structure.We can build it by using array or list.So,I'm ready to devide it into two part,array-making and list-making.

##***Array-makingï¼š***
In this Code,we use array to build a static stack.That mean we cannot change the size of stack because of the feature of arrray.By the way,the array's nature can let us find the element which we want more quickly.

##***List-making:***
Today,we build a stack by using a list.As a satck,it has a LIFO feature.Without out that,a list can make us have a dynamic memory.This is a very good feature in some program.
